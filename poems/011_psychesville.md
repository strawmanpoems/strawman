<pre class="stanza">
the moon is shinin' bright
here in psychesville
the stars are out tonight
here in psychesville
and we're gonna howl all night
here in psychesville

since you left me
i couldn't live
i couldn't kill me
so i spend my nights and days
here in psychesville

dear baby, i hope
this letter finds you well
they doubled up my dose
of little blue pills
the doctor's got me
explorin' some of my childhood dreams
but he don't understand
there's only one thing
haunting me

he said, you're gonna be a while
here in psychesville
we're going to smile
here in psychesville
the nurses sure are pretty and nice
here in psychesville
they got lots of pudding and rice
here in psychesville

since you left me
i couldn't live 
i couldn't kill me
so i spend my nights and days
here in psychesville
