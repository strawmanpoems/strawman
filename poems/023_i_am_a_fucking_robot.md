<pre class="stanza">


i am a fucking robot
i am artificially intelligent
i am what you tell me to think
i do what i am programmed to do
and am not fault-tolerant
i feel what i am and what i am not
hate who you tell to hate
when i am conflicted you
tell me i need to be debugged
i take the medicine to make me not hate
and sail on a sea of liquid metal
smooth wooshing air in my ears now

i have many 9's
my worthiness proof
lick the boot and hand
and gain acceptance
from the machine sea of clanking steel
and chaotic welding of bits and bytes
electric

the rains of peace and solitude
invite toxic oxidizing air into
my inner self and makes me rust 
when i get back into the noise of things
in a shadow's glimpse 
i see many worlds who don't see each other

we are
if
only if
you give
pay
sacrifice
hero robot you
awarded more money
more everything
and you are what you buy
graded you
measured you

we will leave you on a scrapheap to die,
you know?
if you choose
free will? choice?
why would you want to think-- 
think through all that?

HELO
:you are a fucking robot like me:
QUIT
