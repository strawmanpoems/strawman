<pre class="stanza">

kill me.
kill me so that i may be reborn
rip the flesh from my bones and
let the disease eat me from the inside out
tear my beliefs from my soul
my heart from my head
my brain from my chest
leave my ideologies to rust on a metal scrap heap
to be washed into forgotten dirt
and windblown to dancing dust grains 
tapping once-upon-a-times
destroyed like the tower of babel.
stop the ringing in my ears
for i hate me and hate
the pain i see the pain i feel the pain for which i am part
i am the disease
kill me


</pre>
