<pre class="stanza">

kill me
kill me so that i may be reborn
rip the flesh from my bones and
let the disease eat me from the inside out
tear my beliefs from my soul
my heart from my head
lift my brain from my chest
cease my thinking
my feeling
leave my ideologies rusting on a scrap heap
being picked over again and again and again
to deteriorate into grains of dirt
to be wondrously tread on or forgotten or 
wind blown to dancing dust of beliefs
destroyed like the tower of babel 
stop the ringing in my ears
for i hate me and hate
the pain i see the pain i feel the pain for which i am part
i am the disease
kill me


</pre>
