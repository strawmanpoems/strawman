<pre class="stanza">

i became 
aware
of my awareness today
after waking
from dreaming
where jackson and i 
were flying
through a fanstastic
Chinese phantasmagoria
strapped together on bench seats
after waiting
at the airport
which started as a forest
with barren trees
and an
empty river bed
dark with cold dust
and warm musty air
the orbiting world rotated 
beneath our feat as we watched
people milling about
tip tap duck
and kicking falling pebbles uphill
again and again

we were instructed to move
to a waiting area
the bench seats were beyond stained
i sat in fossilized vomit
forever embedded on hard plastic
the entire space moved backwards
as if a shuttle
all
chairs, floors, benches, seats, people,
all
faster and faster
were we taking off?
was this the airplane?

the world as we saw it
faded away
evaporated like hot clouds
and we were soaring through
fantastic candy canyons
painted striped mountains
and massive parade float characters
dancing in the air
amazement and wonder filled us
fear was a distant realm.

i saw her hair
and i saw me looking at her hair
and saw me looking at my looking at her hair
