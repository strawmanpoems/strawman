<pre class="stanza">

a luna moth came to me.
not flying, but crawling,
as if injured, or developing,
searching for safety, or just searching.
it crawled in front of my shoes
as i sat on urban concrete.
its wings gently folded behind its body,
not open and majestic as in the picture, 
and it's swiftness in crawling was curious.
i leaned forward in awe 
at this tragic grace, kreening my head.
under the eave of an odd ledge, 
next to bench, underneath was a fabulous world
i'd never seen.
it sought out the safety of a 
large thorny oblong half-shell,
like a coconut with black gum prickers 
and a tiny opening as a door.
headfirst, inside, then rumbling and turning around 
to face the outside world,
and me.
as if curious, it crawled over my feet,
it's spiny coconut shell protecting
it's fragile wings, body, and life.
crawling quickly, it was not hurt,
was it searching,
up my leg, side, arm, shoulder, and to my neck and ear.
what was this strange fabulous creature?
an old part of me was threatened, 
instinctively wanting to bat a bug away,
but the younger wiser soul of me knew otherwise.
a gift. a message. a blessing.
i can still feel the tiny stickly feet
as they found the skin on my neck,
scratching gently to climb higher,
the antennae inspecting my brain air and hair.
why did it leave? did it find something? 
did it hear something in the distance?
as agile as it ascended, it descended to the urban concrete
and crossed the busy street, gliding effortlessly through
cars and pedestrians who were none the wiser as to this
phenomenal presence.
i followed. what a strange thing! what is it?
it found an opening to a parking garage,
prison bars allowed his passage in,
it found a haven of shelves and a brief moment of solace.
was it running as we all do from the dangers
of masses of feet and concrete?
was it his fear or my fear projected upon him
that made him scury?
what was he looking for?
it aimed again for the street,
my cat woke me up.
