<pre class="stanza">

grandma gave me new gloves for my birthday
tanned leather with broad hard cuffs that never soften
they're worn and old now
stained brown and gently fraying at the fingers
my most prized gift
what was she telling me?
they've built sheds and decks
they remember the dead possum and squirrels
they like wooden handles of hammers and shovels
proud defenders against threats of splinters and jagged sheet metal
they know heat and fire and don't care
coals   weeds   dirt   soil  mud  roots   axe   rope   lumber   wire   cable stone   logs   docks   fish
they remember the days i hurt
and hold my damaged flesh and know my blood well
they remember when i say goodbye
they remember the icy days and know
they weren't made for warmth
they call to me when they're not together
i see her world in them
her face
the pie cutter, the seamstress, the mother, the regrets, the laughs, the blindness, the wheelchair
raised into the van at the party
the confusion.

alone with the lids of jars nailed into the basement rafters
with that old things familiar smell
a hofner bass in the corner 
my chest contorting inside 
cheeks and back of eyes and throat burning

she gave me my gloves
