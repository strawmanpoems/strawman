<pre class="stanza">

[they might be jesus]

she is sat on the train
and looks down to me with fear 
disguised as disgust, so fat,
with empty boxes and bags, 
knocking at space and time
her stained flowered dress would make
for a good kitchen apron or 
curtains in a cabin on the lake

he is laid on the stained concrete
eyes closed, dead or sleeping, 
face dirty gray black from months, years, eternity
of drifting forever in the urban Acheron
his torn clothes grow out of the stone
like wretched death thorns 
the wind blowing his stench of urine
and unknown time in purgatory
what was his crime? 
someone places a bag of torturous hope
within his fetid halo
making some deposit into the national bank of karma.

a reflexed swipe 
a tiny spiny thing crawling on my screen
no sound as it dances from pixel to pixel
so small it seems nothing
what in me wants to kill it
and wipe its smeared guts from my view,
clear its existence altogether?

his tie and her pumps wave and smack financial rhythms 
in wind and street
the hubris oozes waves of red and blue jelly 
and engulfs all those who dare gaze too long
their shame is hidden deep 
deep beneath degrees and titles and and hair products and plastic money
and busy, so busy! so important
more important than
our father who ohmed madne padne ohm

shiva buddha nagga baphoment mosses  
jobs jefferson hitler 
loki thor appolo krishna odin 
lilith vishnu white-buffalo-calf-woman mohamed 
kerouac ghandi kid-picking-on-my-kid
asswipe swiping neck-cranes arched and face sucked into whatever
poseidon ishmael idris
the kim jon un trump putin butt fucking train ménage à trois
and birds shitting on my car

- they might be jesus
