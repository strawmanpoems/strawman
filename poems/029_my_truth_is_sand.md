<pre class="stanza">

I am not a priest,
a monk, 
a shaman,
my 19 virgin mothers left
to live or to die and me to alone
i bear no gifts
i know not the ground from where i rise
and yet i hear echoes
in this attic dream see
distant peoples
my spirit brothers' pierced flesh
the blooded soil beneath my feet
forgetting what grows
this spirit of which i breath and
i fight the burning tears as i walk
and hear the violent flags snap and mock
in the wind's eye
red dirt river, ornate with bones and creosote
and my truth is but sand

</pre>
