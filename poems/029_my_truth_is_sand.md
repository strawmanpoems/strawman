<pre class="stanza">

I am no a priest,
no monk, 
no shaman.
my 19 virgin mothers left
to live or to die and 
me to alone
i bear no gifts
i know not the ground from where i rise
and still i hear echoes
in this attic dream 
see distant peoples
my brothers' pierced flesh
the blooded soil beneath my feet
forgotten invisible growth
this spirit of which i breath and
i fight burning tears as i walk clockwise
and hear the violent flags snap
in the wind's eye behind blue skies
red dirt river, ornate with bones and creosote
and my truth is but sand

</pre>
