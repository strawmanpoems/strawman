<pre class="stanza">

freedom is a right;
good and evil are manufactured concepts;
sense of self adequacy is dependent on acceptance by others;
god is tbd;
faith is a racket;
people will kill the earth;
greed is a great motivator;
people can justify anything;
no one knows their ideology until it's too late;
lying is commonplace;
