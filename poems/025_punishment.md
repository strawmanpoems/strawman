<pre class="stanza">

in a dream
i was in the place
where my father punished me
in their bedroom
i could taste the fear
anticipate the belt or the hand
but it was a metal ring
pierced through the flesh of
my left arm that was to be my atonement

my spirit brothers came to me
long hair 
feathers 
and stones
we were bound by the bridge to the spirit world
their gaze reverent an unafraid
i spoke silently about my fear
about the metal ring that was to 
painfully pierce my flesh

they spoke about living
about mistakes
and how everyone is pierced

i felt the cold metal rip through the flesh of my arm
and saw the large ring dangling
an emblem
a token not to be forgotten

as my spirit brother dressed my wound
i saw his arm
he had many rings of many sizes
dangling from arms
it bound us deeper
