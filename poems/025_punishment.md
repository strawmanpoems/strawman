<pre class="stanza">

in a dream
i was sitting in the place
where my father would punish me
i knew this private room well
i could taste the fear and shame
anticipate the belt or the hand
but it was a metal ring this time
to be thrust through the flesh of my arm 
that was to be my atonement

my spirit brothers came to me
long hair 
feathers 
leather and stone
we are connected by the bridge to the spirit world
their gaze reverent, still, and unafraid
i spoke silently about my fear and shame
about the metal ring that was to 
painfully pierce my flesh
as punishment for me, for my deed

they spoke silently about living
about mistakes

i felt the cold metal rip through the flesh of my arm
and saw the large ring dangling
from my bleeding flesh
a searing emblem
a painful token 

as my spirit brother dressed my wound
i saw his arms
adorned up and down with many pierced rings
many sizes
old and new
dangling through time
and through my dreams
