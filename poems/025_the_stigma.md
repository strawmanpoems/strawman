<pre class="stanza">

in a dream
i was sitting in the place
where my father would punish me
i knew this private room well
i could taste the fear and shame
anticipate the belt or the hand
but it was a metal ring this time
to be thrust through the flesh of my arm
a permanent adornment of shame,
that was to be my atonement

my spirit brothers came to me
long hair 
feathers 
leather and stone
we are connected by the bridge to the spirit world
their gaze reverent, still, and unafraid
i spoke silently about my fear and shame
about the metal ring that was to 
pierce my flesh
as punishment for me, 
for my deed

they spoke silently about living
about mistakes

the cold metal ripped through my flesh
and I saw the large ring dangling
escaping warm red blood 
carving a small rivers that dripped to the floor
this is mine now and forever

as my spirit brother dressed my wound
i saw his arms
adorned wrist to shoulder with many rings
old and new
brass, metal, wood, and onyx
dangling and clanging echoing 
beyond ages
and through me now
