<pre class="stanza">
his voice on the wind,
i hear then know,
i carry this stone,
to the field i must go.

my dress is torn,
the air so still,
smoke rises thin,
where we lay on the hill.

dare to i gaze up
from this ground,
my hands shake cold
in the soil they have found.

once given with heart,
now taken away,
no seed will i sow,
only ashes to lay.

as the smoke yields to the wind,
will our souls find each other again?

yonder breath,
my eyes do not see,
the chill in the air,
my heart does receive.

bury me deep,
sow shut my eyes,
let the vines of this earth
bear my soul to rise.

on heaven's sweet grass,
we'll lay once again,
and love is the dew,
that washes my sin.

as the smoke yields to the wind,
will our souls find each other again?
