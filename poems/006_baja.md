<pre class="stanza">

a black crow rails, at blue sky
baja dust, burns my eyes.
to ensenada we were bound.
had no reason to stick around.  

with wire and dreams,
we'll build your flying wings,
and watch you sail away

in the rear-view, i see you there,
pale blue eyes and a distant stare.
you unsheathed this heart of steal,
yes, my blood and love are real.

with wire and dreams,
we'll build your flying wings,
and watch you sail away.

dew drops fight the dawn and day,
rooster crows the night away.
sand and glass all in my shoe,
a million miles i walk for you.

with wire and dreams, 
we'll build your flying wings,
and watch you sail away.

the sun so red, the sand so blue,
on her salt we'll start a new.
shackles long and cold and gray,
fire and dreams will melt away.

with wire and dreams,
we'll build your flying wings,
and watch you sail away.
