<pre class="stanza">

Pretending all is as it should be, 
or better,
you drift and toss in waves, 
and make up stories about your world and post on social media, 
hoping, praying, *needing* the acceptance.

How fucking pathetic that your value is determined 
by others you cannot touch nor see into their eyes,
or smell their fear, hear their breathing, yet
that is what drives you.

You've not lost your soul, it's stale atrophy
--a dried up dog turd in the sun,
dusted hard white crust, but spoiled inside.
