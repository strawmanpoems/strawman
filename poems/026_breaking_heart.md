<pre class="stanza">

notes bleeding and
ricocheting on urban concrete
i hear her heart breaking
a vivid witness bearing
as steel rails rumbled
the earth shook 
her soul
her pain seethed and radiated
as the she shouted into the air

why was her friend to so quiet?
was she waiting to pick up the pieces for herself?
did she hate
