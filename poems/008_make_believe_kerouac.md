<pre class="stanza">
this is my make-believe kerouac,
imagining the tired old embers,
smoldering,
ash-jumping sparks in search of tinder&mdash;
but what burns?

i lay tired of the mass industrialized commercial ideologies,
polished pig fuckers in a whirling cyclone of shit.

we've all be burned and 
are blindly burning and being burned
again, and again, again,
to the point we don't know what burns

our souls are fresh tinder but
it is always in search and the soul is
a naive child falling helplessly
in love with the idea of *it*  and
so wants, desires, needs and ignites
a passion, a belief too powerful to deny or
regret until the facade if that  belief crumbles
and burns in the face of new burning embers

the enlightened, i think
are those willing to crumble
their beliefs every day, every 
morning as the sun burns through.
