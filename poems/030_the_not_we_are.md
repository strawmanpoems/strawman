<pre class="stanza">

like the others, 
heroic and selfless, 
legendary, 
important, consequential, adequate,
loved by the masses,
adored in the press, 
respected, renowned, beautiful,
special, unique, fit,
knowing what to say, witty,
plugged in, cool,
the not we are are more than what we are

</pre>
