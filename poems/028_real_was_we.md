<pre class="stanza">


real was a song that pin-balled 
across concrete 
dodging echoes of lonely streets-
the milky syringe floating with blood 
a warm miniature lava-lamp of god 
(and Billy's dead now, by the way)-
hollow melodies of women who sold smiles to anyone-
the moist rhythm of thighs and sweet whispers of dreams-
and irresistible allure of anticipation
becoming unstuck in the moment-
there in the lack of possible 
we tasted dreams and (even in the stench) we
were gods and ruled
and we made everything just fine
until 
the next moment slipped into us.

real was we, simply skipping 
on the now stones across a trickle of time
and we could pause it, right?
freeze-frame, replay, skip, skip, skip, over and over, and
we didn't know how we would relish the simplicity, 
or the hiss or the crackle and hum 
and the musty smell of old vinyl and cardboard-
we were dying, really, in the real way
