<pre class="stanza">


real was the song that pin-balled 
across the concrete 
dodging the echoes of lonely streets-
a milky syringe floating with blood and dope
the warm miniature lava-lamp of god 
(and Billy's dead now, by the way)-
the hollow melody of women who sold smiles to anyone-
the moist rhythm of her thigh and sweet whispers of dreams-
the irresistible allure of anticipation
becoming unstuck in the moment-
there in the lack of possible 
we tasted dreams and (even in the stench) we
were gods and ruled
and we made everything just fine
until the next moment slipped into us.
real was we, simply skipping 
on the now stones across a trickle of time
and we could pause it, right?
freeze-frame, replay, skip, over and over, and
we didn't know how we would relish the simplicity, 
the hiss the crackle and hum and smell of old vinyl and cardboard
we were dying in a different way
