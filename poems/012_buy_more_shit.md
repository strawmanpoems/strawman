<pre class="stanza">
buy more shit
you don't have enough
you need more shit

envy those massive steaming mounds
sparkling with luminescent rice bits 
building mountains and castles of poo poo,
little turds zipping by, flying to nowhere,
you are not real until you have shit&mdash;
lots of shit

so, study shit, study
how it's made, 
how it's governed,
how to sell it.
ignore the cost, take a loan, 
peonize your soul--for just a small faction of time,
for the shit you learn feeds the shit you earn

buy more shit
you need more shit
you can't have enough shit

marry the person with the most shit
tell your stinky fingered friends
that they too, one day, can have as much as you,
and if they don't, or you don't, 
have a shitty dinner party,
serve poo pate on toast, with goddess piss,
fruit sprayed with shit, and tossed shit salad,
and lounge your bubbling intestines and talk shit,
a peck on the butt cheek ends the night
where your dreams are filled with shit.

give birth to many little shitters and teach them well
for the amount of shit they gather reflects on
you and all your shitty ancestors.
teach them to fear, 
and to smear the shit they collect in the faces
of those who have those lily-clean asses who have less,
teach them the pretense of caring and sharing,
and isolation, division, class, and privilege

buy them shit
shit to eat, shit to wear,
shit to play with, shit to read,
shit to click swipe text tweet tap dbl-shit click    
shit to make more shit.

lay your body on bed of crisp white hay, 
crackling under your dry and sweating skin,
under bright lights smell the clean chlorine,
hear the beep beep beep of the machines, a death cadence,
surrender to the cold anapestic effervescence of the 
medicine wafts its way up the IV and behind your eyes and 
tastes just like ice cold steel and acid ice 
burning at the back of your throat,
and ripping through all of your tissue and organs.
savor the fear of your mortality, 
for this is the real shit,
you can't buy this shit, or take it with you.
you are dying, you are waking, you are seeing, 
hearing, feeling, doubting, regretting.

it is good you studied so hard,
your job pays for this shit and you have choices:
more shitty chemo, radiation, amputations, radical body-and-soul-ectomies,
more invasive introspections, medications, searching,
more waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting ...
and someone removed somewhere doesn't feel you and is
making a shit-ton with every shitty little choice you make,
and you, you lay alone in dark dulled pain,
with laser focus on a crack of paint,
the LED instrument lights and beeps are an ensemble
playing a surrealistic song that reminds you of 
something you can't quite recall,
the walls echo black in the shadows between wake and sleep,
you must own it now, for in it lies your truth.

buy more shit
