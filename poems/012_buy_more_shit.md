<pre class="stanza">
buy more shit
you don't have enough
you need more shit

envy those massive steaming mounds
sparkling with luminescent bits of rice and corn, 
building mountains and castles of poo poo,
little turds zipping by, flying to nowhere,
you are not real until you have shit&mdash;
lots of shit

so, study shit, 
study
how shit's made, 
how it's governed,
how to sell shit.
ignore the cost, take a loan, 
peonize your soul
    --for just a small faction of time--
for the shit you learn feeds the shit you earn

buy more shit
you need more shit
you can't have enough shit

marry the person with the most shit
tell your stinky fingered friends
that they too, one day, can have as much as you,
and if they don't, or you don't, 
have a shitty dinner party,
serve poo pate on toast, with goddess piss,
cut fancy fuck fruit sprayed with shit, 
and tossed shit salad,
and lounge your bubbling intestines and talk shit,
a peck on the butt cheek ends the night
where your dreams are filled with more shit.

birth many little shitters and teach them well
for the amount of shit they gather reflects on
you and all your shitty ancestors.
teach them to fear, 
and to smear the shit they collect in the faces
of those who have lily-clean asses 
who so sadly have less shit,
teach them the pretense of caring and sharing,
and isolation, division, class, and privilege.

buy them shit
shit to eat, shit to wear,
shit to play with, shit to read,
shit to click swipe text tweet tap snap dbl-shit click chat
code fuck and big data shit,    
and shit to make more shit.
on your knees and unbuckle it,
spread the lily-white valley cheeks
and get in line to give us a good ol' zucker-jobs 
right smack dab on the digital anus.

lay your body on bed of crisp white hay, 
crackling under whats left of your dry and sweating skin,
under bright lights smell the clean chlorine,
hear the beep beep beep of the machines
    --a death cadence--
surrender to the cold anapestic effervescence  
as the chemicals slowly waft their way up the IV,
and you watch as the clear liquid in the tube turns brown
and you trace its path to the needle taped firmly into your crackled arm, 
waiting, like an addict, anticipating, yearning,
swallowing what little saliva you have in your putrid mouth, 
you feel the chemicals as it hits behind your eyes and 
it tastes just like cold steel and acid icicles, 
burning at the back of your throat,
and ripping through all of your tissue and organs.
savor the fear of your mortality, 
for this, this is the real shit,
you can't buy this shit, take it with you, or give it away.
you are dying and are waking at the same time, 
you are seeing, hearing, feeling, doubting, regretting.

it is good you studied so hard,
your job pays for this shit and you have choices:
more shitty chemo, radiation, amputations, radical body-and-soul-ectomies,
more invasive introspections, medications, searching,
more waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting ...
and someone removed somewhere doesn't feel you and is
making a shit-ton with every shitty little choice you make,
and you, you lay alone in dark dulled pain,
with laser focus on a crack of paint,
the LED instrument lights and beeps are an ensemble
playing a surrealistic song that reminds you of 
something you can't quite recall,
the walls echo black in the shadows between wake and sleep,
you must own it now, for in it lies your truth.

buy more shit
