<pre class="stanza">
buy more shit
you don't have enough
you need more shit

envy the massive steaming mounds
sparkling with luminescent rice bits 
building mountains and castles of shit,
little turds zipping by, flying to nowhere,
you are not real until you have shit&mdash;
lots of shit

so, study shit, study
how shit is made, 
how shit is governed,
how to sell shit.
ignore the cost, take a loan, 
peonize your spirit just for a small faction of time because
the shit you learn feeds the shit you earn

buy more shit
you need more shit
you can't have enough shit

marry the person with the most shit
tell your stinky fingered friends
that they too, one day, can have as much shit as you,
and if they don't, or you don't, 
have a shitty dinner party,
serve poo pate on toast, with goddess piss,
fruit sprayed with shit, and tossed shit salad,
and lounge your bubbling intestines and talk shit,
a peck on the butt cheek ends the night
where your dreams are filled with shit.

give birth to many little shitters and teach them well
for the amount of shit they gather reflects on
you and all your shitty ancestors.
teach them to fear, 
and to smear the shit they collect in the faces
of those who have those lily-clean asses who have less,
teach them the pretense of caring and sharing,
and isolation, division, class, and privilege

buy them shit
shit to eat, shit to wear,
shit to play with, shit to read,
shit to make more shit.
buy more shit

lay your body on bed of crisp white hay, 
crackling under your dry and sweating skin,
under bright lights smell the clean chlorine,
surrender to the cold anapestic effervescence of the IV 
as the medicine wafts its way up behind your eyes and 
tastes just like ice cold steel and acid icicles 
burning at the back of your throat,
and ripping through all of your tissue and organs.
savor the fear of your mortality, 
this is the real shit,
you can't buy this shit, or take it with you.
you are dying, you are waking, you are seeing, 
hearing, feeling, doubting. 

it is good you studied so hard,
your job pays for this shit
and you have choices:
more shitty chemo, radiation, amputations, radical body-soul-ectomies,
more invasive introspections, medications, searching,
more waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting ...
and someone removed somewhere doesn't feel you and is
making a shit-ton with every shitty choice you make,
and you, you lay alone in the dark removed from the pain,
with laser focus on a paint crack,
the LED instrument lights and beeps are an ensemble
playing a surrealistic song that reminds you of something you can't quite recall,
the walls echo black in that space between wake and sleep,
you must own it now, for in it lies your truth.

buy more shit
