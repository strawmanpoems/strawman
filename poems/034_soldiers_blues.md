<pre class="stanza">

what would we do
in
the face of 
the horror
the reality
that nothing matters?
(dare to speak the unspeakable!)
when the battle ends 
and survival becomes easy, 
we are burning in empty space,
echoes of smoke and death and purpose,
seek the blank enemy,
but,
what if there is no good, no evil,
no enemy,
and we simply are alive?
our streams flow blue black red 
however we dream
we are not contorting in the current, 
but are the current.
this is the soldier's blues.
no more blood soaked earth and spit,
just empty dust and sand and time.


someone told us
life and creation are sacred,
who makes the sacred ideas?
why god?
 -- in the seventh hour of the seventh day 
 -- man created god in the image of himself
so
he would not have to face the truth
that he is, 
that you and i are, 
simply inconsequential,
and what value to who's heart? 
the earth does not care, 
it's simply a chilled moldy melon ball.
the universe? 
not special, only to be forgotten,
briefly remembered by 
other 
inconsequential beings.
we are told what matters
crucified when we carry 
the challenge torch
and the butterfly effect has no meaning

what in us compels us to love
to protect
to avoid
to fight
to cry
to laugh
sing, dance,
kill?

pain matters
you are one with nothing,
nothing with one and
nothing with nothing.
