<pre class="stanza">

patterns do this
then that
then the other
time eases silently by
swift like a winter river
and we wake
staring
into the still ripples
time freezing for an eternal moment
faces of deeds left undone
cattail reeds in the desert water
drink from this spring
and quench chaotic despair
inhale notes
and
exhale again and again
feel the desperate need to breathe
fragments of fractured lungs
flutter whistle and wheeze
and growl of regret
and forever lost chances
d.c. al coda
the ii-v-i with resolution
to earth
or
smoke
who remembers?
who cares?
