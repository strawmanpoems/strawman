<pre class="stanza">
i'm not leaving you,
you're not leaving me,
let's get out of here
and make some eggs and biscuits

don't remember what
we just said,
please don't fix your hair
and get your ass up out of bed.

who was that chinese guy?
he smelled like heroin
i think he died last night
he won't be doing that again

leave that thing behind
and your wallet too
i hear the cops downstairs
grab those eggs and biscuits
