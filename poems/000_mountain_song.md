<pre class="stanza">
a searing distant call 
mounted behind twisted teeth 
black from tobacco and neglect 
pierces blue and cold 
like the mountain pines. 

smoke-filled snow 
whispers cruelty and death 
with unrelenting chaotic rhythm. 
i hear your song 
it echoes from ice-covered boulders 
filing the valley void 
seeking only open ears 
skipping like impish fairies 
over fallen leaves and sticky needles.

the vastness within is littered 
with the nameless notes i 
move one at a time to nowhere 
i inhale your melody 
caress the bitter air with warm 
tears and 
draw my liar's soul out 
into the cold light.
