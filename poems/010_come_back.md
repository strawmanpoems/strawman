<pre class="stanza">
come back, baby, come back
i'm beggin' you please
come down off that train
and into my arms
your love sets me free

come back, baby, come back
i promise to change my ways
no more stayin' out all night long
and confess on sunday

i put down that bottle
and i picked up a job
i even showed up on time
i said goodbye to what's her name 
from once up a time

come back, baby, come back
i'm down on my bended knee
i'll pawn my watch
and this here old guitar
to get you a pretty ring

i put down that bottle
and i picked up a job
i even showed up on time
i said goodbye 
to that sweet little thing
form hollywood and vine

come back, baby, come back
i'm beggin' you please
come down off that train
and into my arms
your love sets me free

your love holds the key
