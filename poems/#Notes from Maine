#Notes from Maine

Good and Evil are man-made fallacies
righteousness begets wrongness
Where there is good there must be evil
Where there is right, there must be wrong
Yet the moral Yin Yang is not the same
as the balance in earth
cold and dark, warm light, 
are not symbols of good or evil
we made these distinctions to
create an "order" to things--man made order--
	-- how many versions have been created?
	-- these are morals, these are the rules that keep people controlled
where there is, in fact, no order, or we cannot 
comprehend the natural order of things
Being *civilized* presupposed some notion of order
Civilization is a mask of order

"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 4And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness."

And the night is bad. It is dark


"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.""
