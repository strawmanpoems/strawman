<pre class="stanza">

when I run
the wind in my ears sounds like the ocean.
it mutes the the crazy, the mean, the scary.
i know i am going away, and that's what i want.
i don't want to go back, so, i keep running.
if i run fast enough, they will not catch me,
the wind sound turns me invisible gray, blending with air.

when i close my eyes, i can see what i want. 
the dark is cool and calm, and is nice to me.
but i hear them anyway. i know they want to hurt me.
i don't belong here. 

if i run fast enough they won't catch me.
if i hit my head like drums they leave me alone.
i cry and scream and they go away. 
sometimes they go far. sometimes they wait by the fence.
but they're there. they're always there. they never go away.

what if i run with my eyes closed?
i will hear the seashells' gentle whispers,
i will see memories of branches through my eyelids,
moving, dancing, chasing through the darkness 
as i try to catch them with my eyes.

maybe i will hit something hard,
a tree, a wall, a car,
maybe i will run off a cliff,
or fall down stairs.
maybe if i run hard enough and hit something at full speed
i will break through the other side and be home.
