<pre class="stanza">

we are no longer need,
any one, two, three,
any thing, where bells once ring,
and tissue we are,
cool leaves and warm air,
and salt and water,
alone not even in death,
know blood is soil,
spirit us, mind you.
solitude, quiet, isolation--
these do not exist.
funny how we slice the world
into pies.
