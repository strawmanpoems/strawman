<pre class="stanza">

i've had this kind of
fucked up day
the kind of day that won't go away
no matter what i do
to me
or to you

she's wrapped around the axle
'bout something she  won't say
and i'm here in between
gold 
and vaseline

my friends at work got fired
for doing what they do
what in god's name
were they thinking
[even] the bugs on [in/behind] my wall
are blinking

[solo over verse]

you look just like a ghost
fading in the breeze
the dark mist of your breath
on my neck
on my knees

see, i've had this kind of
fucked up day
the kind of day that won't go away
no matter what i do
to me
or to you
